    "# Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Statistics Notebook we will be going over Bayes Theorem and an example of how to use it. This theorem will be important to understand in many situations and we will be using it for Machine Learning in certain lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by describing the equation for Bayes Theorem and then complete an example problem. There won't be a SciPy portion to this lecture because this is really more of a math overview than a discussion on a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem  describes the probability of an event, based on conditions that might be related to the event. Bayes Theorem allows us to use previously known information to asess likelihood of another related event.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will usually see Bayes Theorem displayed in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here P(A|B) stands for the Probability that A happened given B has occured. These are both the same, in the second case, you would use this form if you don't directly have the Probability of B occuring on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and dive into an example Problem to see how to use Baye's Theorem!\n"

    "### Example Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic example of Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a test to screen for breast cancer, with the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1% of women have breast cancer \n",
    "- 80% of mammograms detect breast cancer when it is there\n",
    "- 9.6 % of mammograms detect breast cancer when it is *not* there. (False Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "We could assign the probabilities to the  sample space by using a table:\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <td></td>\n",
    "    <td>Cancer (1%)</td>\n",
    "    <td>No Cancer (99%)</td> \n",

    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <td>Tested Positive</td>\n",

    "\n",
    "We can first visualize Bayes Theorem by filling out the table above:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",

    "    <td></td>\n",

    "\n",
    "So, our chance of cancer is .008/.10304 = 0.0776, or about 7.8%.\n",

    "\n",
    "This might seem counter intuitive at first but it makes sense: the test gives a false positive 10% of the time, so there will be a ton of false positives in any given population. There will be so many false positives, in fact, that most of the positive test results will be wrong.\n",
